The Beginning
[13:27- Above the capital city. From a G.U.N. helicopter]

Soldier: Sigma-Alpha 2 heading due south over the city.
Pilot: We're en route, everything's a go.
Control Tower Associate: This is control tower. We have you on radar. Report cargo status of captured hedgehog aboard, over!
Pilot: That's a 10-4. Cargo secured and... [surprised] What?!
Control Tower Associate: Didn't copy that, over!
Pilot: The hedgehog's gone, he's taken out everyone aboard and...
Control Tower Associate: What's wrong! Come in, over!
Pilot: What in the world!? [Sonic busts out of the helicopter and grabs onto the side of it] Freeze! What do you think you're doing!? Get that hedgehog!
Sonic: [Hops on top of the helicopter and rips off a large piece of metal] Talk about low budget flights, no food or movies... I'm outta here! I like running better! [jumps off the helicopter and spins into the city while on the metal board] Yeah!
Big Foot Arrives
Sonic: This game of tag is boring! I'm outta here! [Big Foot appears] Ha! finally decided to show up, eh? Okay, bring it on!
After defeating Big Foot
Sonic: [Looks up] What?
[A black colored hedgehog is seen on top of the defeated Big Foot holding a Chaos Emerald.]

Shadow: [Holding up the Chaos Emerald] It all starts with this... A jewel containing the ultimate power...
Sonic: [Surprised That's the... Chaos Emerald! [Walks toward Shadow] Now I know what's going on! The military has mistaken me for the likes of you! So...where do you think you're going with that Emerald!? [Starts running toward Shadow] Say something! You fake hedgehog!
Shadow: Chaos Control! [Activates Chaos Control and quickly warps past Sonic]
Sonic: [Surprised] Wow...he's fast! Hey, it's not his speed. He must be using the Chaos Emerald to warp!
Shadow: [On top of a building] My name is Shadow. I'm the world's ultimate life form! There's no time for games... farewell. [Uses Chaos Control to warp away]
Sonic: [Blinded by the light] Kuu! Shadow... what is he?
[As Sonic opens his eyes, he is suddenly surrounded by G.U.N.]

GUN Soldier: Don't move! Stay were you are! Keep your hands up in the air.
Sonic: Huh? Not again!
Enter Knuckles
[11:08 Desert area - Knuckles and Rouge are seen near the Master Emerald arguing.]

Rouge: Just let it go. You just don't know when to give up, do you?
Knuckles: What are you talking about? That Emerald's mine! [raises fist] You got that? The Master Emerald contains special powers that neutralize the energy of the Chaos Emeralds. That makes it very powerful! [looks up] What the...?
[Eggman snatches the Master Emerald with a claw that descends from his Egg Mobile]

Rouge: Woah...thief!
Knuckles: Look who's calling who a thief!
Eggman: I came here following the signal from the Emerald... If I'm not mistaken, this is the Master Emerald, is it not?
Knuckles: It's you... Dr. Eggman!
Rouge: So that's Dr. Eggman.
Eggman: [Preparing to leave] Well, I guess I can use it for something. I'll just take it with me. Farewell knucklehead!
Knuckles: Not if I can help it! [Leaps after Eggman and destroys the Master Emerald]
Rouge: Aaaaaaaah! [Grabs Knuckles' shoulders and shakes him] What was that all about? And look what you did to MY Emerald!
Knuckles: I did that to prevent the Master Emerald from being stolen, you idiot! If it's in pieces, I can restore it. And by the way, that's not YOUR Emerald!
Eggman: [To himself] Hmmm, doesn't matter. I'll look into it once I get back to the base. [Flies away]
Rouge: [Watches Eggman leave then turns back to Knuckles] I despise anyone who takes jewels from me! All the world's gems are mine to keep!
Knuckles: Yeah, we'll see about that bat girl!
Rescuing Sonic
[11:56 Prison Island: Nearby airspace - Tails is seen flying over the sea in his Tornado.]

Tails: There's no mistake about it, this must be the island. It's a secret military base that is reinforced and super strong! It's called Prison Island. I heard the news about it on satellite TV. I still can't believe that Sonic would destroy the military buildings or rob the bank! Wait for me, OK Sonic! I'm on my way! [Looks down and spots Amy being chased by Eggman] What? Hey, look it's Amy! And Eggman too! What's Amy doing here? Doesn't matter. I have to help Amy because she's in danger! Tornado... Transformation!
[The Tornado transforms into a walker machine.]

After defeating Eggman
Eggman: This time, I'll let you go. But the next time we meet...You won't be so lucky! [Leaves]
Amy: Wow Tails, you did it! But what are you doing here on this island?
Tails: I'm the one who should be asking that question! Don't you know it's dangerous here?
Amy: I know, but I'm here to save my hero, Sonic!
Tails: Again?
Amy: Hurry! I know Eggman's up to no good again!
Tails: OK, you stay here and I'll be right back! [Leaves]
Amy: Don't leave without me! I wanna help Sonic too! [Follows after Tails]
Prison Island Escape
[Amy arrives at Sonic's cell.]

Sonic: [Pacing around in his cell and notices Amy] Huh, Amy?
Amy: Shhh! Keep your voice down! Have no fear, [spins] Amy Rose is here!
Sonic: How did you get here?
Amy: [Holding a card] Well, if you gotta know... I caught a ride with Tails! Are you sure you don't need my help? It looks like you could use it.
Sonic: The reason I'm in here is because of that fake hedgehog!
Amy: You mean that black hedgehog?
Sonic: Did you see it? Where is it now?
Amy: If I tell you, will you marry me?
Sonic: No way!!
Amy: I thought I had you this time! [Slides the card through a card reader and unlocks Sonic's cell, Sonic walks out] That black hedgehog came here with Dr. Eggman.
Sonic: So, Eggman's behind this. huh?
Amy: [Walking around] What's all that writing on the wall anyway? Did you write that? [Turns around and sees that Sonic is gone] Wait for me Sonic! He's such a brat sometimes!
Face Off with Shadow
[After clearing Metal Harbor, in a forest]

Sonic: Phew... so far so good! [spots Shadow] Hey, that's...
Shadow: That blue hedgehog again of all places...
Sonic: I've found you, faker!
Shadow: Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here. You're comparing yourself to me? Ha! You're not even good enough to be my fake!
Sonic: I'll make you eat those words!
[After fighting Shadow]

Eggman: [From Shadow's walkie-talkie] Shadow! What are you doing? Hurry and get back here right now before the island blows up with you on it!
Sonic: [surprised] Blows up!?
[Shadow listens to the message then leaves]

Sonic: I gotta get out of here and find Amy and Tails right away! [runs off]
Ghost Mountain
[After clearing through Green Forest the entire island explodes, with Sonic, Tails, and Amy all barely escaping on the Tornado] [17:30 - In an mountainous region]

Knuckles: [At Pumpkin Hill] This place sure feels haunted... There's no time to lose! I have to hurry and find that Master Emerald!
World Domination
[Day X 18:00 - Eggman is broadcasting his message across earth and the people on earth turn to listen to him]

Eggman: Hah, hah, hah! Citizens of earth, lend me your ears and listen to me very carefully! My name is Dr. Eggman, the world's greatest scientist, and soon to be the world's greatest ruler! Now, witness the beginning of the greatest empire of all time!
[Suddenly, the Eclipse Cannon is revealed from the Space Colony ARK and it fires a blast that destroys half of the moon. The people of earth watch in horror at what just happened and Eggman laughs as the time shows a little less than a 24 hours until the Eclipse Cannon strikes earth. In the city, Sonic, Tails, and Amy just witnessed what had happened]

Amy: Look, half of the moon is gone!?
Sonic: Eggman! Oh, that creep never gives up!
Tails: But how did he managed to harness all of that energy?
Sonic: It's got to be the Chaos Emeralds... Yeah, that's the reason they were looking for them. [Notices Tails take out a Chaos Emerald] Tails...
Tails: The Chaos Emeralds are like magnets...they have the power to attract each other. If I can use that to find where Eggman is.
GUN Soldier: The three of you, FREEZE! [G.U.N. closes in on Sonic, Tails, and Amy] Put your hands in the air and get on the ground!
Sonic: Tails! I'll take care of the police while you try to find a way out of here! Find Eggman!
Tails: Got it!
[Sonic and Tails run off]

Amy: The three of you, that mean me too! Hey, wait! [Runs after them]
Aquatic Mine
[20:21 Mountainous region: Mine]

Knuckles: [In Aquatic Mine] Hmm, I didn't expect the inside of the mines to be like this! This is going to be tougher than I thought!
Where's Eggman?
[9:03 In the capital city. Tails and Amy are seen, with Tails talking to Sonic on his phone]

Sonic: [From Tails' phone] Sheesh! There always seems to be a lot of police around when you don't need them! Tails, any news yet?
Tails: For some reason, I'm not getting a signal from the six remaining Chaos Emeralds... Maybe Eggman took the Emeralds into outer space.
Amy: Outer space?
[Suddenly, a nearby manhole opens up and Knuckles climbs up from it]

Amy: Knuckles!
Knuckles: Hey guys, long time no see! I must have got lost in the mines! Looking for the Master Emerald pieces was tougher than I thought it would be. Where are we anyway? [Amy suddenly starts to pull him out] Hey, where are you going?
Amy: Move aside Knuckles!
Tails: I managed to find the transcripts between Eggman and the President in the government computer. I'm following the President's limo right now! If we can get into the limo, we can trace the call to find Eggman!
Sonic: [From Tails' phone] OK! Let's meet up there! [Hangs up]
[Tails races off to get to the President's limo]

Amy: Hey! Wait for me Tails!
Eggman's Hidden Base
[In the President's limo driving through the city]

Secretary: Mr. President, reports show that since the incident, three hours ago, the country is in turmoil. Our financial communities are impacted and our satellite communications are down. An emergency meeting has been called. Mr. President, this is a national crisis.
President: Spare me the details. Exactly what is it you want? Dr. Eggman?
Eggman: [from a video monitor] Hahahaha! Well, let's just get down to business then, shall we Mr. President? I won't bore you with all the details since I know you are a very busy man. Mr. President, my demands are quite simple. Surrender to the Eggman Empire and make no attempts to resist! Otherwise...
President: Otherwise?
Eggman: [from a video monitor] Otherwise your country will cease to exist! You have 24 hours to give me your answer!
Sonic: No way!
President: What the...
[Sonic is seen running right beside the limo, then he leaps inside]

Sonic: Eggman Empire...yeah right!
President: What the heck is going on here?
[Tails is seen messing with the monitor]

Sonic: Don't worry, Mr. President, everything is under control. Just leave it to us! Got it Tails?
Tails: [Holding a disk] I got it! He's transmitting from the space colony ARK!
Sonic: OK! Let's move it! [Leaps out of the limo]
Tails: Wait up, Sonic! [Flies after Sonic]
President: Hey you... wait!
Assistant: Mr. President, we're receiving an incoming signal from our agent.
[13:04 Desert area - Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy are near Eggman's secret base]

Sonic: Inside that pyramid?
Knuckles: I saw Eggman go inside the pyramid and more importantly, I saw that bat girl go inside with him as well. [turns to Amy] You saw them too, right?
Amy: Well yeah.
Sonic: We should be able to get into outer space from there! I don't know what's this spacy colony is all about but I'll find and destroy that cannon... and then kick their imperial butts!
Knuckles: All right!
Tails: I'll go and find the entrance! [walks off]
[After clearing through Hidden Base, Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy are near a locked door]

Tails: Looks like we're heading toward the center of the base.
Sonic: That egghead sure loves mechanical things doesn't he? I bet he has one or two spaceships lying around somewhere.
Tails: [Examines the door] The door is locked. We need a key to get in there.
Sonic: No problem, we can find it, right Knuckles?
Knuckles: What? Why do I have to find the key?
Sonic: We're counting on you buddy! The world's greatest treasure hunter!
[After clearing through Death Chamber, Knuckles is in an enclosed room]

Knuckles: [Hears a laugh] Huh? Who's there? [Turns around to see King Boom Boo] What the... a ghost?
Shuttle Blast-off
[After defeating King Boom Boo]

Knuckles: Huh...that was pretty rough.
Tails: We did it! Let's go Amy!
Amy: Yeah!
Eggman: You little thieves! Did you really think you could get out of here alive?
[Everyone turns around to find Eggman appearing from a door nearby]

Sonic: Come and get some Eggman!
Tails: Sonic!
Sonic: Just leave it to me!
Eggman: This time, I'll take your lives as well as the Chaos Emerald! I call on you to destroy these pests. Come out my servant!
[The Egg Golem rises]

The Space Colony "ARK"
[The pyramid opens up revealing a large rocket]

Automatic Voice: Ready for launch! Primary engines on! Beginning lift-off countdown! [Sonic is seen running onto the rocket] 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...Shuttle lift-off!
[The rocket blasts off into space heading for the ARK; Sonic and the others are in the rocket heading for the ARK]

Sonic: So this is the space colony that Eggman is hiding.
[The rocket crashes into an asteroid]

Sonic: Woah!
Tails: Is everyone alright?
[The hatch in the rocket opens up releasing the pieces of the Master Emerald]

Tails: We should be landing soon.
Knuckles: Oh no! The hatch doors are open!
Sonic: Don't sweat it Knuckles! The only thing in the cargo bay are the Master Emeralds. Right?
Knuckles: What do you mean "don't sweat it?" Land the shuttle and let me out! [Tries to take control of the rocket]
Sonic: Knock it off Knuckles! We're going to crash this thing if you keep that up! Oh no! Don't touch that lever!
[The rocket suddenly starts to spin out toward the ARK]

Sonic: Woah!!
Amy: Ahhh!!
Tails: Woah!!
[Inside Space Colony ARK - Cannon countdown: 2 hours 11 minutes]

Sonic: What's up with that knucklehead anyway! Trying to take over the shuttle! I thought we were toast for sure! [Looks around to find Knuckles isn't there] Huh? Where did he go now?
Tails: Looks like he bailed!
Amy: This place looks deserted! Dusty too!
Tails: This place was shut down about 50 years ago because of a terrible accident. The first Bernoulli spherical space colony called, ARK. When it was operational, it was the most advanced research center of it's kind, but looking at it now..
Amy: Now it's an abandoned ARK, wouldn't you say?
Sonic: There's not much time left before Eggman fires that weapon again... We've got to hurry! Let's find the cannon and destroy it!
Tails: Yeah! [Typing on his computer in his Tornado] Someone designed that weapon to be impenetrable from outside attacks. [Shows a diagram of the ARK] Its defense system are super strong so we have to find a way to destroy it from the inside!
Amy: [Looking at Tails' Chaos Emerald] Isn't that a Chaos Emerald?
Tails: It looks like it doesn't it? But in fact, it's a fake one that I created after researching the real Emerald! It has the same wavelength and properties but is less powerful than the real one. It's designed to reverse the energy field inside the Chaos Emeralds and blow up! It looks so real, even a machine can't tell the difference! I'll find the power supply and destroy it! Sonic, you find the control room, OK? [Gives Sonic the fake Chaos Emerald]
Sonic: So the plan is, we'll switch the Chaos Emeralds when the machine is stopped, right?
[Sonic and Tails walk off]

Amy: I hate you! You guys always leave me behind and have all the fun! ["fun" echoes for a moment]
Last Pieces of Master Emerald
[After clearing through Eternal Engine] [Inside Space Colony ARK - Cannon countdown: 45 minutes; Sonic is in the central control room]

Tails: Ok Sonic, now put that Emerald...
Eggman: [Cuts Tails' transmission off] Ahem! Tails, tell Sonic to meet you back at the research facility! Now!
Tails: Sonic, Amy is...
Sonic: I didn't get that Tails! What's happened to Amy? Tails!
[Outside Space Colony ARK - Cannon countdown: 1 hour 26 minutes]

[After clearing through Meteor Herd; Knuckles and Rouge are seen on the central tower of Meteor Herd]

Rouge: Long time no see treasure hunter. Did you find MY Emeralds?
Knuckles: That's a good one! YOUR Emerald. Talking to you is a waste of time!
Sonic in Trouble
[After fighting Rouge]

Knuckles: Whew!
Rouge: Whew!
Knuckles and Rouge: Stop fooling around, and give me back MY Emeralds!
Rouge: What are you blabbing about? You call yourself a hunter? Attacking a lady... Shame on you!
Knuckles: What kind of lady goes around stealing gems anyway?
Rouge: Those belong to me! [Trips and starts to fall off of the tower] Aahhh!
[Rouge falls closer and closer to the lava until Knuckles grabs her arm, saving her and helping her back up]

Rouge: What in the world?
Rouge: Keep your hands to yourself! Don't touch me!
Knuckles: Is that how you say thanks to someone who just saved your life?
Rouge: Saving my life, don't think I owe you one! You just wanted to to hold my hand didn't you? That's why you saved me! You're such a creep!
Knuckles: This isn't a joke, you know! Think what you want bat girl, I was saving the Master Emerald.
Rouge: No matter what you say, it sounds crazy! [Drops her pieces of the Master Emerald toward Knuckles]
Knuckles: Wha...?
Rouge: Fine, then just take them. They stink like echidnas do.
Knuckles: [Picks up the pieces] If that's what you thought, you should have given me them in the first place! [The Master Emerald is put back together] Finally!
Rouge: What?
Knuckles: I'm sorry...if I hurt you. [Runs off]
Rouge: We should get going. [Takes one last look back, then runs off]
[After clearing through Crazy Gadget]

[ARK: Research lab - Cannon countdown: 33 minutes; Sonic enters the room with Eggman, Tails, and Amy in it]

Eggman: [Pointing gun toward Amy] Let's take care of business first, shall we Sonic? Hand over the Chaos Emerald, slowly, and then we will talk about your girlfriend! That is if you really care for her...
Sonic: [Whispering to himself while holding the fake Chaos Emerald] Handing over the fake Emerald, I can kill two birds with one stone.
[Tails looks over at Sonic and gives him a nod]

Eggman: Put the Emerald down right there and BACK OFF!
Sonic: [Smirking and starts to walk toward Eggman] You've turned into a big time villain, doctor!
[Eggman chuckles and suddenly traps Sonic in a glass pod]

Eggman: You thought you could trick me with that fake Emerald, didn't you?
Tails: So... how did you know it wasn't the real one?
Sonic: Tails!
Eggman: Because you just told me, fox boy!
[Tails looks dumbfounded as he just gave away their plan]

Eggman: Now, for a little space ride! The capsule clears the colony, BAM!
Sonic: I'm counting on you Tails! And Amy, take care of yourself!
Eggman: Farewell! Sonic the Hedgehog!
[Eggman ejects Sonic into outer space]

Amy: Sonic!
Tails: [Echoed voice from earlier] It has the same wavelength and properties...but is less powerful than the real one!
Sonic: [Staring at the fake Emerald] The same wavelength and properties... [picks up the fake Emerald] But can I do this?
[A massive explosion is then seen]

Eggman: Farewell Sonic... My admirable adversary!
Amy: SONIC! [cries]
Eggman: Now we have some unfinished business to take care of! If you give me the real Emerald, I will release you both. You have my promise!
Tails: Sonic... Sonic has asked me for the first time to do something for him. [looks up] I won't let him down. I won't give up!
Last Chance
[After fighting Eggman]

[Outside Space Colony ARK - Cannon countdown: 21 minutes, 7 seconds]

[Knuckles is seen in a room]

Knuckles: I feel some strange energy...
[Sonic suddenly warps in]

Knuckles: Hey, Sonic!
Sonic: [Gets up] Woah, I wasn't sure if I could pull that one off. Somehow, I managed to use the Chaos Control.
Knuckles: Chaos Control? [Helps Sonic stand up] Are you OK?
Sonic: I'm worried about Tails and Amy! I hate to ask but could you help them? This is our last chance! [Holding the fake Emerald] I got it! Before the cannon fires, I'll slam dunk it in there! [Runs off]
[After clearing through Final Rush]

[Outside Space Colony ARK - Cannon countdown: 5 minutes 44 seconds]

[Sonic is seen standing near the way to the cannon]

Shadow: [Walks up beside Sonic] You never cease to to surprise me blue hedgehog. I thought that capsule you were in exploded in space.
Sonic: [Starts jogging slowly] You know what I can say... I die hard! [Camera pans to the fake Emerald] You actually saved me, you know.
Shadow: It was a Chaos Emerald, wasn't it? But, there's no way you could have activated the Chaos Control using an Emerald that's fake. [Sonic and Shadow start to run faster] So, there's more to you than just looking like me. What are you anyway?
Sonic: What you see is what you get! Just a guy that loves adventure! I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!
[Sonic and Shadow run at their top speed]

Shadow: I see. But you know, I can't let you live! Your adventuring days are coming to an end!
[After defeating Shadow]

[ARK: Abandoned lab - Cannon countdown: 1 minute 33 seconds]

Tails: Sonic, I did it!
[Tails gets a call from his walkie-talkie, while Eggman is seen reaching for the Emerald]

Sonic: Awesome job, Tails!
Tails: Sonic!
Sonic: Look outside!
[Tails and Amy looks out a nearby window to see the Eclipse Cannon being destroyed. Sonic is seen on the remains and gives a thumbs up and his trademark smirk towards the camera]
